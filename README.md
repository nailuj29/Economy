# Economy
A basic economy bot for discord. Needs a `.env` file with the database uri (`MONGO_URI`) and bot token (`BOT_TOKEN`). Also requires a `appsettings.json` if you want to use the dashboard.

Requires this element:
```json
"DatabaseSettings": {
    "ConnectionString": "uri",
    "DatabaseName": "Economy"
 }
 ```
